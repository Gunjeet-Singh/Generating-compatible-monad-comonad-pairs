# Generating-compatible-monad-comonad-pairs
Script for generating and counting compatible pairs and topological compatible pairs of monad-comonad pairs defined on the poset P(X) - the powerset of a finite set X.
For generating the Moore (and co-Moore) families over P(X) - which correspond to monad (and comonad resp.), we follow a depth-first search algorithm as suggested in Higuchi's paper https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0012365X9700099X.
